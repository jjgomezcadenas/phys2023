The Drake equation is a means of estimating the number of communicative ETCs in the Galaxy.

The commemorative plaque is on the same wall that held the blackboard where the equation was first written.

The fraction $f_l$ of suitable planets on which life actually develops; the fraction of these planets on which life develops intelligence $f_i$; and the fraction $f_c$ of intelligent life-forms that develop a culture capable of interstellar communication. Finally, we need to know the time $L$, in years, that such a culture will devote to communication.

“Think?” Fermi was distracted, chasing one of his bright ideas, uncoupled, us usual, from the rest of the World. “Think about what?”

“Little green man stealing waste bins”, said Teller.

“Oh. About ten percent probability, I would say”.

Everyone laughed. “Ten percent probability” was the curious way in which Fermi referred to something impossible\footnote{\url{https://www.revistamercurio.es/2023/10/02/that-summer-in-the-fuller-lodge/}}.

\begin{itemize}

\item Guided the Principle of Mediocrity (a.k.a., principle of Typicality, a.k.a Copernicanism) which states that there is nothing special about Earth or our Solar System, Fermi's calculation could have gone something like this. $R \sim 1$ star/yr\footnote{\url{https://www.astronomy.com/science/ask-astro-how-many-stars-are-born-each-year-in-the-milky-way/}};
$f_p \sim 0.1, n_e=1$ \footnote{\url{https://nineplanets.org/questions/how-many-planets-are-in-the-milky-way/}}. The other factors were hard to determine then and now.

%
%\item Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, a scientific visionary, believed  that ultimate reality is entirely of one substance. If all parts of the Universe were the same, (a position close to that of Copernicanism that holds that there is nothing special about our patch of Universe) it followed that there must be other planetary systems similar to our own, and that some of those planets would possess life.
%\item Tsiolkovsky also firmly believed that mankind would construct habitats in the Solar System and then move out into space. He famously said: 
%``Earth is the cradle of intelligence, but it is impossible to live forever in the cradle.''
%\item But then if humans expand into space, all those other species should do the same. Tsiolkovsky was aware that this led to a paradox when maintaining both that mankind will expand into space and that the Universe is brimful with intelligent life.
%\item In 1933, long before Fermi asked his question, Tsiolkovsky pointed out that people deny the existence of ETCs because (i) if such civilizations existed, then their representatives would have visited Earth, and (ii) if such civilizations existed, then they would have given us some sign of their existence.
%\item He only offered his preferred solution (today dubbed the ``Zoo'' or ``Reservation'' or ``Star Trek Policy" hypothesis): he believed that advanced intelligences consider mankind to be not yet ready for a visitation.

\item In 1974, Michal Hart argued that there are four categories of explanation for fact A. {\bf 1.}, ``physical explanations'' (e.g., space travel is unfeasible), {\bf 2.}, ``sociological explanations,'' (we will discuss ``Zoo'' hypothesis" in a second ). {\bf 3.}, ``temporal explanations," (ETCs have not had time to reach us). {\bf 4.}, ``unlikely explanations'' (previous visitations, UFO). 
%These categories were meant to exhaust the possible explanations for Fact A, although, as I will discuss shortly, there are other categories of possible explanations that he did not consider. 
%\item One could ask to the list the so-called ``solipsist solutions'', which include the ``Planetarium hypothesis'' (we live in a simulation), and the ``Hermit hypothesis'' (advanced ETCs develop a Hermit culture and never talk to each other). 
%\item Yet another group would include the ``Catastrophic hypothesis'', which in turn subdivide in two blocks. ``Natural catastrophes" and ``Sociological catastrophes".
%Hart then forcefully showed how none of these four categories provide a convincing account of the key fact, which led him to offer his own explanation: we are the first civilization in our Galaxy.

 \item
 In 1973 John A. Ball wrote a paper published in Icarus called ``The Zoo Hypothesis''\footnote{Ball J., 1973, Icarus, 19, 347}. in which he posited an answer to the Fermi paradox involving the deliberate non-communication of advanced ETCs (extraterrestrial civilisations) elsewhere in our universe. This implies that extraterrestrial intelligences (ETCs) have agreed to not contact the Earth. 
 \item There are a number of variants of the Zoo hypothesis, (e.g., the {Interdict hypothesis} of Fogg\footnote{https://doi.org/10.1016/0019-1035(87)90112-6}), all suggest that there is a uniform cultural policy of advanced extraterrestrial civilizations to avoid any form of contact (including having a visible manifestations) with the newcomers to the ``Galactic Club''.

\begin{itemize}

%\item {\bf Concerning space travel}, Hart argues that ``generation-ships'' propelled by fusion energy and travelling at speeds of $0.1 \times c$ are ``realistic'' and therefore well within the reach of advanced ETCs. Indeed, given enough resources one could argue that human kind could build such space ships in O($10^2-10^3$ yrs). {\em According to Hart, then, space travel (and fast expansion of ETCs through the galaxy) are feasible}. 

\item In his paper Hart analyzed the Zoo hypothesis together with several others such as ``The Contemplation Hypothesis (a.k.a, The Eremite Hypothesis), which states that ETCs have no interest in space exploration and the  ``Self-destruction hypothesis'', by means of nuclear power, or other agents (or recent: biohazards, IAGs and perhaps plain stupidity).  {\em He, then dismissed all of them on the grounds or {\bf Realism} and {\bf Hardness}}. 
\item His analysis could easily be extended to many other ``explanations'' that we could call ``solipsist'', and include the ``Planetarium Hypothesis" (and close cousin, ``Simulation Hypothesis, both of them state that we live in a virtual reality).

These properties are usually perceived correctly and obey the laws of physics. 
%

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Also called Principle of Hardness}.  Favours those hypotheses which involve a smaller number of local causes. 
\item Consider for example the self-destruction hypothesis. To be valid, we would need to postulate that all civilizations in the Galaxy self-destruct, likely soon after developing nuclear weapons. This, in turn, requires many local causes acting independently in a uniform way to achieve the desired explanatory end. In other words, such solution is exclusive (or ``soft''). In contrast, a non-exclusive (or ``hard'') solution rely on a small number of independent causes. Hart argued (also correctly) that most ``sociological scenarios'' were soft. 
\item Another example, the Zoo hypothesis requires to assume an unwarranted uniformity of motive for ETCs over extremely long periods of time. If even a single civilization choses to colonize the galaxy, the explanations fail. There are ways to guarantee such uniformity (e.g, a ``dictatorial galaxy'') but at the expenses of realism.

\item Any control of a colony by the parent civilization will at most be very weak, and the time scale for development of colonization capability by a colony is long; hence each colony develops its own culture which is independent of the culture of the civilization that originally settled it.  
\item The percolation rule is as follows: A culture may have a colonization drive, or may not. A civilization which has a drive to colonization will establish colonies on any stars within reach. If it does not have any unsettled stars within its colonization radius, however, it will of necessity develop into one without a colonization drive. Thus, any given colony will have a probability $P$ that it develops a colonizing civilization, and a probability $(1-P)$ that it will develop a non-colonizing civilization.

 The percolation explanation of the Fermi paradox is robust because it do not depend on the values of the parameters or the details of the assumptions.

 \begin{itemize}
\item  If $P < P_c$, and colonization stops rapidly; 
\item If $P = P_c$, uncolonized areas of arbitrarily large extent exist, in one of which the
Earth is located; 
\item If $P > P_c$, Earth is located in one of many small unoccupied void.
\item A baseline assumption for colonization would be that stars are suitable for a colony only if they are of a spectral type not too different from the sun, say F8 through G9 main sequence, and not binaries. From the 1969 Gliese catalog, the set consists of five possible stars within a distance of 30 light years from the sun. A reasonable guess for N, then, might be 5.
\item There is no way at all of making a reliable estimate of the value of P. For our own civilization, it seems equally likely that we may destroy ourselves, fail to destroy ourselves butnot expand into space, or continue expanding until interstellar colonization is possible. A guess of $P=1/3$ is as reasonable an estimate as any. Interestingly enough, these values for N and P result in a model of the galaxy as being very near critical, and thus with extremely large ``colonized'' regions and equally large ``empty'' regions.

 The galactic habitable zone (GHZ) is the region of our Galaxy where complex life is possible. The GHZ is primarily characterized by distance from the Galactic Center (GC).
%The galactic habitable zone is the region of a galaxy in which life might most likely develop. The concept of a galactic habitable zone analyzes various factors, such as metallicity (the presence of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium) and the rate and density of major catastrophes such as supernovae, and uses these to calculate which regions of a galaxy are more likely to form terrestrial planets, initially develop simple life, and provide a suitable environment for this life to evolve and advance. In the case of the Milky Way, its galactic habitable zone is commonly believed to be an annulus with an outer radius of about 10 kiloparsecs (33,000 ly) and an inner radius close to the Galactic Center.
\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
\item As that distance to the GC increases, {\bf star metallicity} (the presence of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium) declines. Metals are necessary for the formation of terrestrial planets.
\item {\bf The X-ray and gamma ray radiation} from the black hole at the galactic center, and from nearby neutron stars, becomes less intense as distance increases. Thus the early universe, and present-day galactic regions where stellar density is high and supernovae are common, will be dead zones.
\item{\bf Gravitational perturbation} of planets and planetesimals by nearby stars becomes less likely as the density of stars decreases. Hence the further a planet lies from the GC or a spiral arm, the less likely it is to be struck by a large bolide which could extinguish all complex life on a planet.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Item \#1 rules out the outermost reaches of a galaxy; \#2 and \#3 rule out galactic inner regions. Hence a galaxy's habitable zone may be a relatively narrow ring of adequate conditions sandwiched between its uninhabitable center and outer reaches. Lineweaver et al. calculate calculate the GHZ to be a ring 7 to 9 kiloparsecs in radius, including no more than 10\% of the stars in the Milky Way. Thus $f_{GHZ} = 0.1$

\item According to REH universe is fundamentally hostile to complex life. Thus, while microbial life may be common in the universe, complex intelligent life (like the evolution of biological complexity from simple life on Earth) required an exceptionally unlikely set of circumstances, and therefore complex life is likely to be extremely rare. 
\item Among the essential criteria for life which can be packed in $n_e$ are a terrestrial planet with plate tectonics and oxygen, a large moon, magnetic field, a gas giant like Jupiter for protection and an orbit in the habitable zone of the right kind of star. 
\item Other factors that can be packed in $f_{cl}$ or $f_c$ are events during the Earth's geological past such as Snowball Earthand the various mass extinction events that nearly destroyed life on Earth arguably make the existence and survival of complex life rare as well.

%\frametitle{Rare Earth Hypothesis}
%The Rare Earth hypothesis (REH, Ward \& Donal, 2000) expands the argument that complex life could be a rare phenomenon, arguing that complex biospheres like the terrestrial one, are very rare due to the exceptional combination of many distinct requirements:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item {\bf Circumstellar habitable zone}: a habitable planet needs to be in the very narrow interval of distances from the parent star.
%\item {\bf Rare Moon}: having a large moon to stabilize the planetary axis is crucial for the long- term climate stability.
%\item {\bf Rare Jupiter}: having a giant planet (``Jupiter'') at right distance to deflect much of the incoming cometary and asteroidal material enables sufficiently low level of impact catastrophes.
%\item {\bf Rare elements}: Radioactive elements (especially U and Th) need to be present in the planetary interior in sufficient amount to enable plate tectonics and functioning of the carbon-silicate cycle.
%\item {\bf Rare magnetosphere}, essential to deflect cosmic rays.

Observations of exoplanets have shown that arrangements of planets similar to the Solar System are rare. Most planetary systems have super-Earths, several times larger than Earth, close to their star, whereas the Solar System's inner region has only a few small rocky planets. Only 10\% of stars have giant planets similar to Jupiter and Saturn, and those few rarely have stable, nearly circular orbits distant from their star.
 \column{0.55\textwidth}

According to the REH, our planet has an improbable orbit in the very narrow habitable zone (dark green) around the Sun that makes possible:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Liquid water}, necessary for complex life.
\item {\bf An atmosphere}, neither too thin (Mars), nor too thick (Venus), with the right amount of greenhouse effect (currently being disturbed by humans).
\item {\bf A planetary system} capable of sustaining complex life, with small, rocky inner planets and massive outer gas giants which act as ``celestial vacuum cleaners'' avoiding frequent catastrophic asteroid collisions in inner planets.

The Moon may be essential to maintaining our planet's magnetic shield by continually acting upon the metallic core as dynamo, thus protecting the surface of Earth from charged particles and cosmic rays, and helping to ensure the atmosphere is not stripped over time by solar winds.

 \column{0.55\textwidth}
The Moon could have been formed from the impact of a Mars-sized body (Theia), with the young Earth. This giant impact also gave the Earth its axial tilt (inclination) and velocity of rotation. Rapid rotation reduces the daily variation in temperature and makes photosynthesis viable. The impact may also have initiated plate tectonics, without which the continental crust would cover the entire planet, leaving no room for oceanic crust.

If the Earth had no Moon, the ocean tides resulting solely from the Sun's gravity would be only half that of the lunar tides. A large satellite gives rise to tidal pools, which may be essential for the formation of complex life.
It also increases the likelihood of plate tectonics through the effect of tidal forces on the planet's crust.

\begin{itemize}
\item
REH could be an example of circular reasoning, which simply describes what happened on Earth. Yet
the improbable sequence of events leading to complex life and intelligence on Earth could have been mirrored by other sequences of improbable events elsewhere.  

\item Almost all assertions of REH have been challenged. For example: recent observations suggest that rocky planets orbiting within habitable zones may not be rare and the requirement for a system to have a Jovian planet as protector has been seriously questioned %(Kastings, 2001, Horner and Jones, 2008). 
%Plate tectonics may not be unique to Earth or a requirement for complex life; Free oxygen may be neither rare nor a prerequisite for multicellular life; A magnetosphere may not be rare or a requirement.

Prokaryotes appeared $\sim$ 4 Gyr ago, early after the collision with Theia. Eukariotes only appeared 2 Gyr ago, and the Cambrian explosion 0.5 Gyr ago. 

 \column{0.55\textwidth}
 
All eukariotes share a common ancestor, which implies that this event can only have happened once. Nick Lane\footnote{\url{https://nick-lane.net/books/life-ascending-the-ten-great-inventions-of-evolution/}} and others argue that prokaryotes lack the cellular architecture to evolve into eukaryotes because a bacterium expanded up to eukaryotic proportions would have tens of thousands of times less energy available to power its metabolism. Two billion years ago, one simple cell incorporated itself into another, multiplied, and evolved into mitochondria that supplied the vast increase in available energy that enabled the evolution of complex eukaryotic life. If this incorporation occurred only once in four billion years or is otherwise unlikely, then life on most planets remains simple.

\begin{itemize}
\item Meyr\footnote{Bioastronomy News, vol. 7, no. 3, 1995.} and others have argued that the evolutionary path from primitive Cambrian chordates to Homo sapiens, was a highly improbable event. For example, the large brains of humans have marked adaptive disadvantages, requiring as they do an expensive metabolism, a long gestation period, and a childhood lasting more than 25\% of the average total life span.
\item The fact that humans did not already go extinct may on itself be ``rare''. In fact, Human ancestors nearly went extinct 900,000 years ago\footnote{\url{
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02712-4}}

%\item In many aspects, humans are extremely ``unlikely'': bipedalism, eye-hand coordination
%(whichvpermits dextrous manipulations of the physical environment with the hands) and a vocal apparatus enabling speech which in turn makes possible for humans to interact cooperatively, to share knowledge, and to acquire a culture.
%The capability of formulating abstractions to a degree permitting the invention of mathematics, and the discovery of science and technology may also be very rare and unique of Sapiens (e.g, not sufficiently developed in our close cousins, the Neanderthals). Last but not least, humans have acquirer their current scientific and technological sophistication only very recently.

%\begin{itemize}
% 
%\item Evolution never moves on a straight line toward an objective ("intelligence") as happens during a chemical process or as a result of a law of physics. Evolutionary pathways are highly complex and resemble more a tree with all of its branches and twigs.
%
%\item
%Adaptations that are favored by selection, such as eyes or bioluminescence, originate in evolution scores of times independently. Instead, high intelligence has originated only once, in human beings. A possible reason is that high intelligence is not at all favored by natural selection, contrary to naive expectations. In fact, all the other kinds of living organisms on Earth millions of species, get along fine without high intelligence.
%
%\item The other possible reason for the rarity of intelligence is that it is extraordinarily difficult to acquire. Some grade of intelligence is found only among warm-blooded animals (birds and mammals), not surprisingly so because brains have extremely high energy requirements. But it is still a very big step from ``some intelligence'' to ``high intelligence.''
%
%\item A large brain, permitting high intelligence, developed in less than the last 6 percent of the life on the hominid line. Mayr argues that it requires a complex combination of rare, favorable circumstances to produce high intelligence.

\begin{itemize}

\item 
An astrophysical (necessarily ``hard'') explanation of FP would be  preferable over a sociological one, and presumably more testable and less speculative than
many of the REH propositions.

\item  Much of the tension caused by Fermi’s paradox stems from the tacitassumption of equilibrium state. Instead, James Annis\footnote{Annis, J.: 1999a, J. Brit. Interplanet. Soc., 52, 19.}  has proposed the phase transitionidea, which is a prototype disequilibrium hypothesis.

\item A plausible astrophysical scenariofor a delay in the emergence of intelligent observers and their technological civilizationsis the existence in the Galaxy of a global regulationmechanism. Such a mechanism could occasionally reset astrobiological ``clocks'' allover the GHZ and in a sense re-synchronize them. Thus:
\end{itemize}
 
\begin{block}{}

There is no Fermi'sparadox, since the relevant timescale is thetime elapsed since the last ``reset'' of astrobiological clocks and this can be substantiallysmaller than the age of the Milky Way or$t_M - t_E.$

\item However, the frequency of resetting events decreased due to the astrophysical evolution of theGalaxy (e.g, decrease of GRBs), and at some time  the balance shifts towardhigh probability of complex intelligent observers emerging and creating large interstellarcivilizations. That is the epoch of phase transition.
